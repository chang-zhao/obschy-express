# obschy-express

Working demo might be found here (or not):

https://demo.obschy.ru/

An example of navigation header written in Node.js + Express + MongoDB for data + Redis for sessions.

Supports changing UI preferences and display language (via AJAX calls).

I tried to learn how to to write server-side javascript (Node.js + Express), and hence created this app.

It's just for historical purposes, or in case I will need to go back from Koa.js to Express.

There may be errors, not sure I care. I don't plan to ever update this repo, but reasonable PR's are welcome.

Don't try to login, it's just a demo.
